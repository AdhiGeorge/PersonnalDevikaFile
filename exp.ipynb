      "Yes, many Azure services support **customer-managed keys (CMK)**, allowing you to bring your own encryption keys for added control and security over your data. These keys are typically stored in **Azure Key Vault**, a secure cloud repository for secrets, keys, and certificates. Below are examples of Azure services that support customer-managed keys:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Azure Storage (Blob, File, Table, and Queue)**\n",
      "   - Supports CMK for encrypting data at rest using Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "   - Provides enhanced security where you can rotate keys or revoke them at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Azure SQL Database**\n",
      "   - Supports **Always Encrypted** feature with customer-managed keys to encrypt sensitive data.\n",
      "   - Integration with Azure Key Vault for managing column-level encryption keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Azure Cosmos DB**\n",
      "   - Offers the ability to use customer-managed keys for data encryption at rest to ensure greater data security.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Azure Virtual Machines (Disk Encryption)**\n",
      "   - Can use customer-managed keys to encrypt disks attached to Virtual Machines with **Azure Disk Encryption** or **Server-Side Encryption**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Azure Synapse Analytics**\n",
      "   - Supports CMK for encrypting data with customer-defined encryption keys stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Azure Data Lake Storage**\n",
      "   - Data encryption at rest with customer-managed keys via integration with Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Azure Managed Disks**\n",
      "   - Supports encryption-at-rest with customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**\n",
      "   - Encrypts data in **etcd** (the AKS-managed cluster metadata store) using customer-managed keys from Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 9. **Azure Cognitive Services**\n",
      "   - Certain Cognitive Services allow for encryption of data at rest using customer-managed keys (e.g., Azure Form Recognizer).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 10. **Azure Backup**\n",
      "   - Allows using customer-managed keys to encrypt backed-up data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 11. **Azure Key Vault itself**\n",
      "   - Though it's the central repository for managing CMK, Key Vault's secrets and keys can also be encrypted using customer-managed keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 12. **Azure Purview**\n",
      "   - Supports customer-managed keys for encrypting sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 13. **Azure Kubernetes Security Features**\n",
      "   - CMKs can be used to encrypt secrets for containers and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 14. **Azure Machine Learning**\n",
      "   - Offers encryption for workspace resources and artifacts with customer-managed keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits of Customer-Managed Keys:\n",
      "- **Control:** You can revoke or rotate keys whenever needed.\n",
      "- **Compliance:** Helps meet regulatory requirements and industry standards.\n",
      "- **Security:** Ensures encryption keys are fully managed by you, providing a higher degree of data protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Azure's support for customer-managed keys is extensive across its services, enabling a unified strategy for data security. Always refer to the specific service's documentation to confirm its CMK capabilities and implementation details.\n"
